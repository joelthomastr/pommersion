# Pommersion

*A game of language learning through immersion*

| General Information | |
| ----------------- | ---------- |
| Game time         | 60 minutes |
| Number of players | 1-8 players<br>1 moderator<br>helpers (optional) |
| Purpose | To learn something new in your target language! |

## Concepts

The **players** are motivated language learners. Their goal is to learn something new in the target language: a new word, a new construction, or a new phrase. Everyone who learns at least one new thing wins the game!

The **moderator** is the person who keeps the game going and enforces the rules. The goal of the moderator is to make sure that:

- All players learn something new in the target language
- Everybody has a good time!

The moderator can also be a player.

It is good if the moderator speaks the target language, or if some friends who speak the target language can be present as **helpers** to answer questions. But this is not necessary.

A **pomodoro** is a period of immersion. The most important rule of a pomodoro is this: **During a pomodoro, players can only speak in the target language.** Apart from this, there are no limitations on what players can do to make themselves understood. Hand signs, charades, and props are all allowed.

There are regular **breaks** to give players an opportunity to ask questions in their own language.

## Gameplay

A game of Pommersion lasts for 60 minutes:

* First pomodoro (10 minutes)
  * First break (5 minutes)
* Second pomodoro (10 minutes)
  * Second break (5 minutes)
* Third pomodoro (10 minutes)
  * Third break (15 minutes)

### During a pomodoro

The moderator tells each player when it is their **turn**. Each player gets at least one turn during a game. Usually all players get one turn each before a player gets a second turn, but the moderator can make exceptions if necessary.

During their turn, it is up to the player what they talk about, and with who. For example, they can:

- Pick up a prop and ask what it is.
- Say a sentence and ask if it was correct.
- Start a sentence and show that they want someone else to help them finish it.
- Start a conversation about a topic to try some new vocabulary.
- Just chat!

The player can decide that their turn is over whenever they want. Or, if they take too long the moderator can end their turn.

### During a break

Everybody is free to speak whichever language they want.

The moderator gives each player an opportunity to ask questions about the target language. The first two breaks are short, so questions and answers have to be short and sweet. Complex questions and answers must be left until the third break.

## Backstory

When adults learn a language, they often spend most of their time and energy on learning *about* it. This doesn't work, because the key that unlocks the brain's language acquisition circuits is immersion, or meaningful and motivated communication in the target language.

But immersion is hard. Opportunities for immersion can be few and far between, and especially for English speakers there can be ways to avoid them.

*Pommersion* is a portmonteau of *pomodoro* and *immersion*. It uses the essential elements of the pomodoro technique in a game that gives adult language learners what they need: stress-free time *in* the language, and time to talk *about* the language.

It is designed to be playable over a videoconference call such as Zoom.
