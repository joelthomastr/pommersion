# Pommersion

*A game of language learning through immersion*

| General Information | |
| ----------------- | ---------- |
| Game time         | 60 minutes |
| Number of players | 1-8 players<br>1 moderator<br>helpers (optional) |
| Purpose | To learn something new in your target language! |

## Overview

The **players** are motivated language learners. Their goal is to learn something new in the target language: a new word, a new construction, or a new phrase. Everyone who learns at least one new thing wins the game!

The **moderator** is the person who keeps the game going and enforces the rules. The goal of the moderator is to make sure that:

- All players learn something new in the target language
- Everybody has a good time!

The moderator can also be a player.

It is good if some friends who speak the target language can be present as **helpers** to answer questions. The moderator can also be a helper. It's good to have helpers, but even without them the players can still learn something new from each other or from whatever books or apps they have available.

See the [Guidance for Roles](#guidance) section for more information about how these roles interact.

A **pomodoro** is a period of immersion. The most important rule of a pomodoro is this: **During a pomodoro, players can only speak in the target language.** Apart from this, there are no limitations on what players can do to make themselves understood. Hand signs, charades, and props are all allowed.

There are regular **breaks** to give players an opportunity to ask questions in their own language.

## Gameplay

A game of Pommersion lasts for 60 minutes:

* First pomodoro (10 minutes)
  * First break (5 minutes)
* Second pomodoro (10 minutes)
  * Second break (5 minutes)
* Third pomodoro (10 minutes)
  * Third break (15 minutes)

### During a pomodoro

The moderator tells each player when it is their **turn**. Each player gets at least one turn during a game. Usually all players get one turn each before a player gets a second turn, but the moderator can make exceptions if necessary.

During their turn, it is up to the player what they talk about, and with who. For example, they can:

- Pick up a prop and ask what it is.
- Say a sentence and ask if it was correct.
- Start a sentence and show that they want someone else to help them finish it.
- Start a conversation about a topic to try some new vocabulary.
- Just chat!

The player can decide that their turn is over whenever they want. Or, if they take too long the moderator can end their turn.

### During a break

Everybody is free to speak whichever language they want.

The moderator gives each player an opportunity to ask questions about the target language. The first two breaks are short, so questions and answers have to be short and sweet. Complex questions and answers must be left until the third break.

## Backstory

When adults learn a language, they often spend most of their time and energy on learning *about* it. This doesn't work, because the key that unlocks the brain's language acquisition circuits is immersion, or meaningful and motivated communication in the target language.

But immersion is hard. Opportunities for immersion can be few and far between, and especially for English speakers there can be ways to avoid them.

*Pommersion* is a portmonteau of *pomodoro* and *immersion*. It uses the essential elements of the pomodoro technique in a game that gives adult language learners what they need: stress-free time *in* the language, and time to talk *about* the language.

It is designed to be playable over a videoconference call such as Zoom.

## Guidance for Roles <a name="guidance"></a>

Please be sure to read the notes below about your role before you play your first game of Pommersion.

### How to Be a Player

1. **Know what you want to learn.** It's good to have something in mind before the game starts. But be careful not to set your sights too high. Don't forget, you only need to learn *something* new before the end of the game to win!

2. **Don't be intimidated** when you see that other players are more advanced than you. Don't forget, when it's your turn you will be the one who sets the level, and everybody else will fit in with you.

3. **When your turn comes, get creative!** The rule of a pomodoro is that you aren't allowed to *speak* any language other than the target language. That doesn't mean you have to communicate using *only* the target language. You're free to use hand gestures, facial expressions, funny noises, pantomime, the objects around you, or any other trick you can think of so long as you don't *speak* any other *language*. Because you're still immersed! Use this freedom to the fullest to make yourself understood.

4. **Watch and learn.** You can pick up some new words and grammar as well as other cool communication techniques from the other players.

5. **No pressure.** Don't feel shy. But if you do, feel free to pass when it's your turn. You can still learn new things when it's not your turn, either during the pomodoros or the breaks.

6. **Make the most of the breaks** to ask questions in your own language. Once the pomodoro is over, you can ask anything you like about what just happened.

If you are a more advanced player, sometimes you can also be a helper. But please make sure you read through the guidance for helpers before you jump in.

### How to Be a Moderator

Your main job is to make sure that *everybody* has a *good* time.

1. **Make sure that all the players feel included**, and that they feel that they learned something by the end of the game. This means that you particularly need to look after the shy ones.

2. **Make sure that none of the players feel pressured.** Make sure that all players get a turn, but if a player decides to pass or end their turn early, respect that.

2. **The player whose turn it is sets the language level.** Without meaning to, more advanced players and helpers can jump in and take over. If necessary, kindly take back control and give it back to the player whose turn it is.

3. **Keep the game moving.** The more confident players can eat up all the time if you let them. If you realize that a player is taking too long and there won't be enough time left for the others, kindly end their turn.

4. **Stick to the time limits.** Remind people to stay in the target language during pomodoros.

If you are a player, give yourself a turn. If you are a helper, all the guidance for helpers also applies to you.

### How to Be a Helper

It's great to have you on board! Without you the players would only have each other, so thanks for being here. But with great power comes great responsibility. You have the power to make or break the game.

1. **Don't worry about sharing too little. Worry about sharing too much.** The purpose of the game is to learn *something* new, not *everything*. If you share too much you can overwhelm the players and they won't have a good time.

2. When it's a player's turn, **allow them to decide** how much they want to learn, and from who. They may decide to talk to another player who is on a level closer to them instead of you. Maybe this is because they feel nervous about talking to a proficient speaker like you, so resist the temptation to jump in. Only interrupt if you see that the players are about to learn something that is definitely incorrect.

3. When a player decides to talk to you, **let them take their time**. If they take time to search for a word, patiently let them search. Only finish their sentence for them if they ask you for help with their eyes.

4. **Stay at the player's level.** Do your best to understand the level of the player whose turn it is, and speak with them at that level. When you sense that something is new for them, just focus on helping them learn the new thing. Don't introduce another new thing until they tell you that they are ready.
